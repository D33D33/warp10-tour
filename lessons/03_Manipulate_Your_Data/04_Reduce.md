# Overview of Reduce

Reduce are also well-known transformation used in many libraries. Thanks to it, you are able to **reduce a set of BUCKETIZE GTS to a single GTS**.

## Example

In this example, we're creating two GTS called GTS1 and GTS2, with some values:

| Timestamp | Value of GTS1 | Value of GTS2 |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|
| 10        | -42           | -211          |
| 20        | -123          | -42           |

Thanks to reduce, we're able to reduce them into one single GTS and apply a mean function, according to the label0 information.

| Timestamp | Value of GTS1 |
|-----------|---------------|
| 10        | -126.5        |
| 20        | -82.5         |
